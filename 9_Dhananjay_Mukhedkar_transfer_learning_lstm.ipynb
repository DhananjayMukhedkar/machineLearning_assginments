    "# Tutorial 9: Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) and Transfer Learning\n",
    "\n",
    "Welcome to the ninth tutorial of the course 'Machine learning for Precision Medicine'.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this exercise we will touch on two important topics in modern machine learning research: RNNs and transfer learning.\n",
    "\n",
    "We have prepared a dataset for you, consisting of 4104 drug-reviews with corresponding (subjective) ratings and effectiveness scores. This dataset was derived from the **Drug Review Dataset (Druglib.com)** on the [UCI Machine Learning Repository ](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Drug+Review+Dataset+(Druglib.com)).\n",
    "\n",
    "Your task will be to build a predictor that is able to predict the rating from 1 to 10. You will be free to implement a second model that predicts the effectiveness.\n",
    "\n",
    "To build this predictor, we will first encode the reviews using sentence embedding. Every sentence of each review will be encoded as a vector of 512 numbers, using a pre-trained *universal sentence encoder* available on [TensorFlow Hub](https://tfhub.dev/google/universal-sentence-encoder/2) and published [arXiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/1803.11175). These vectors represent the content of each sentence in a dense vector. The universal sentence encoder was trained on a large corpus of text - much larger than our training set.\n",
    "\n",
    "The model that encodes our sentences was trained with the Stanford Natural Language Inference (SNLI) corpus. The SNLI corpus is a collection of 570k human-written English sentence pairs manually labeled for balanced classification with the labels entailment, contradiction, and neutral, supporting the task of natural language inference (NLI), also known as recognizing textual entailment (RTE). Essentially, the model was trained to learn the semantic similarity between the sentence pairs.\n",
    "\n",
    "After embedding the sentences, aach review (which will then be represented as a sequence of embeddings), will be fed into an LSTM in order to predict the rating.\n",
    "\n",
    "The process of taking a model that was trained on a different task and using it for a new task is called transfer learning. Often the pre-trained model was trained with a lot more data than is availble for the new task. Transfer learning is usually a good idea if the number of training examples is small.\n"

    "RNNs are usually designed to learn patterns in sequential data, i.e. text, genomes, sensor data, ...\n",
    "LSTMs (Long-shortterm memory) models are a type of RNNs to model sequential data. Sequential data follows some structure, i.e. language follows grammar rules. With a CNN only the current sample (i.e. image) is used as an input. RNN's however, also take previously seen samples as input for the feed-forward input, which adds together as two input sources, present and past data with the aim to predict new data. To feed back past data to the input, the the output of a neural network layer at time t goes back to the input of the same network layer at time t + 1. This is what is considered as memory. The sequential information is preserved in the recurrent network’s hidden state and essentially what RNNs do is sharing weights over time.\n",

    "\n",
    "We pass this $g$ through the input gate, which is basically a layer of sigmoid activated nodes. The idea behind these sigmoid activated nodes is to exclude elements of the input vector that are not relevant (pass the associated weights when sigmoid output of this node is close to 1, and exclude when close to 0). Then we do an element-wise multiplication of the output and the squashed input.\n",

    "__Forget gate:__  \n",
    "In the next step, we add the internal state variable st, which lagged one time step i.e. st−1, to the input data and pass it through the forget gate. This is an addition operation (not multiplication) reduces the risk of vanishing gradients. In the forget layer the model learns which state variables should be “remembered” or “forgotten”.\n",
